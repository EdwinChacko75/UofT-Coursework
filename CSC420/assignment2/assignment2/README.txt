Welcome to my CSC420 Assignment 2 ReadMe!

Requirements:
 - python3.10
 - See imported libraries
 - GPU

Run command:
 - python3.10 <F_NAME>

---------------------------- 

Data:
The below links are for the data. The first link is the data after cleaning and is used in Tasks II to IV.
The second is used in Task V and is flattened. Note that both datasets can be used for Task V, so YOU DO NOT 
NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE SECOND ONE. But if the first does not work for whatever reason (it should work), you can use
the second for Task V. 
Once you download the data, unzip it and replace the placeholder directories "placeholder1" and "placeholder2" with the 
actual data sets. The structre should be such that the subdirs of both data and task5_data are the two datasets,
"DBIsubset" and "SDDsubset". 

Link to "data" folder:         https://drive.google.com/file/d/13vOTmD2fqOi9qfLMviYsXh5n58SF8OTn/view?usp=drive_link

Link to "task5_data" folder:   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1asv2vWhUKXaJWTsbeaYjgooAGRdQn5RQ/view?usp=sharing


----------------------------

Structure:
There are four other directories from the data placeholders, each named task{i} for each task of the Assignment. 
The entry point for each task is the main.py in the corresponding task subdir. Yes much of the code is copy paste
but this is good because you can run each task independently of the rest. 
For tasks with plotting, the plots can be found in "task{i}/plots/".
Note: there are comments in some of the main.py files that provide more running options. 

----------------------------

Thats about it but heres a step by step just to clarify:

1. Download the data

2. Replace placeholders such that "placeholder1" -> "data" and "placeholder2" -> "task5_data". And the subdirs are the two datasets.

3. Run main.py in each task directory.

4. Give me 200/200 (most important step)
