Welcome to my CSC420 Assignment 3 ReadMe!

Requirements:
 - python3.7
 - See imported libraries

Run command:
 - python3.7 <F_NAME>

---------------------------- 
 

Task 1:
Entry point is './task1/main.py', this is also the only file.

NOTE: DO NOT CHANGE THE load_from_cache VARIABLE OR IT WILL OVERWRITE.

Other than that you just run it and specify in the terminal which case is being run.
You can put in it lowercase. It will pop up the images one by one and you can close them all.

All the plots are in the assets directory with good naming so navigating it is pretty straightforward.
The plots of interest are '*_mapping.png' and '*_matches.png'. The .npz files in the ./task1/ directory
are used to load the points from cache. 

If you run it three times, one for each case, it will generate the '*_mapping.png' and '*_matches.png'
plots but not the '*1.png' and '*2.png' plots. All the plots are included all the same.

The hallway images may or may not be included, depending on if they fit the markus file size limit or not.
In the case that they do not, please download them and place them in the './task1/' directory.

---------------------------- 

Task 2:

Just run the file. Both will generate and print in the terminal. All plots availible in the assets directory.
